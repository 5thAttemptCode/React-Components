                  It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop

        content: `Vue's dual nature as a library and framework offers a unique advantage. As a framework, Vue provides a cohesive 
                  ecosystem of tools like Vue Router and Vuex, ensuring scalability and streamlined development. However, using Vue 
                  as just a library offers more flexibility but may require more effort for integration.

                  While frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the user's browser while the app is running, Svelte 
                  shifts that work into a compile stejp that happens only when you build your app, producing highly optimized vanilla JavaScript.
